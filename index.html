  <h2>About Us – Root Marks</h2>
  <p>Root Marks is more than just a brand — it's a vision that took root in the heart of Nived Devan, who founded it during his teenage years with a mission to build something meaningful, helpful, and rooted in strong community values.</p>
  <p>What began as a small travel initiative has now evolved into a dynamic multi-service platform with the help of his friends and mentors offering professional services in tours and travels, event management, and real estate. At its core, Root Marks is driven by a commitment to quality, affordability, and the empowerment of local communities.</p>
  <p>We aim to make travel more accessible through our branch Tripy Kerala, offering customizable, budget-friendly and luxurious travel packages that help you truly explore the culture, beauty, and heritage of each destination.</p>
  <p>In the events space, we organize everything from destination weddings and birthdays to musical shows and public functions, handling all aspects — from venue and décor to entertainment and logistics.</p>
  <p>Our real estate division connects people with opportunities to buy, sell, or invest in properties with transparency and trust.</p>
  <p>At Root Marks, we don’t just offer services — we build experiences, opportunities, and a community that grows together.</p>
